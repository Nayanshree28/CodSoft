# Task1: Number Guessig Game:
1.Initialize the random number generator and generate a random number between 1 and 100.
2.Prompt the user to enter a guess and compare it with the random number.
3.Provide feedback to the user if the guess is too high or too low.
4.Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the guess matches the random number, then display the number of attempts it took the user to guess correctly.

#Task2: Simple Calculator:
1. User input:
   - Prompt the user to enter two numbers and an operation.
   - Read the input and store them in `value1`, `value2`, and `operation`.

2. Perform the operation:
   - Declare a variable `output` to store the result.
   - Use a `switch` statement to perform the operation based on the value of `operation`.
   - Add, subtract, multiply, or divide `value1` and `value2` based on the chosen operation.
   - Store the result in `output`.

3. Display the result:
   - Output the result using `cout` if the operation is valid.
   - If the operation is division and the second number is zero, display an error message.

4. End the program:
   - Return 0 to indicate successful program execution.
